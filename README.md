# Moodle Agent

The Moodle agent was developed to allow a user to send their login information when encountering an issue. It does not require any tables in the Moodle database.

The Moodle agent has two modes of operation :

## Simple Mode

The simple mode enables the user to copy and paste their login information, which can then be shared, for example, through a hotline.

To activate this mode, an administrator simply needs to uncheck the **mailenabled** box in the plugin settings.

## Advanced Mode

The advanced mode allows the user to describe their issue and send their information via email.

The plugin in this mode offers several features :
- **supportemail** : The administrator's email address will receive the user's information along with the description of the issue.
- **mailto** : It is possible to cc a second email address (such as a distribution list, for example).
- **subject** : It is possible to customize the email subject.

The user can send their information to the platform administrator via email with a single click from their dashboard.
